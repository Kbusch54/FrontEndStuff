<p>HTML tags use tags to identify html content.<em> This for example is in</em>
<strong> paragraph.</strong>
</p>
<h1>Page Content</h1>
<p>The main page content appears inside the <strong>body</strong> tag. HTML contains several 
elements that allows you to properly structure your format and content, which we'll cover later.
</p>
<h1>Content models</h1>
<p>In HTML 4 there were only two main content models, blocks and inline elements. 
<strong>Block level</strong> elements would stack on top of each other in normal document 
flow while <strong>inline level</strong> elements typically appear within the flow of text content.
</p>
<p>In this example the <strong>heading 1</strong> and the <strong>paragraphs</strong> are block 
level items, while the bold tags and the link below are examples of inline level elements.</p>
<p>In HTML 5 new content models have been created to expand the structure and semantic capabilities 
of HTML. There are seven main models: <strong>Flow, Metadata, Embedded, Interactive, Heading, 
Phrasing and Sectioning.</strong> To learn more about them, visit the

W3C HTML5 specification.
