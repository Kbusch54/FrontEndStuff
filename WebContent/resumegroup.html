<p>Hi my name is Kevin Busch I am 24 years old I worked in a retail environment, where I dealt with customers on a daily basis.   Have been both apart and ahead of a team, managed inventory and . I just finished a 12 week program at per scholas, a full stack developing course that also discusses the process of agile and scrum. One of my goals is to find purpose in what I do and in my pursuit of becoming a developer I have found purpose and passion for continuous learning in and out of tech. </p>
